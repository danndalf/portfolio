title: Rebirth
byline: Rebirth is an LED lightboard I built with John Windberg displaying a modified version of an artificial life algorithm. It's one of the simplest models of a self-reproducing Turing machine, and in this form the emergence lives indefinitely based on random co-occurrences.

		<p>Rebirth is an LED lightboard I built with John Windberg displaying a modified version of an artificial life algorithm. It's one of the simplest models of a self-reproducing Turing machine, and in this form the emergence lives indefinitely based on random co-occurrences.</p>

		<p>This lightboard makes appearances around Seattle-area electronic music events, and is heading to Burning Man 2015 as a part of the <a href="http://tautology.io/art/inflection/">Inflection art project</a>.</p>

		<p>Full arduino source for this board <a href="https://github.com/tautology-art/rebirth/blob/master/rebirth.ino">is available on GitHub</a>.</p>
