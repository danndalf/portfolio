title: Synaesthesia Guitar
byline: This is a guitar that I've modified to simulate <a href="/superpowers">my form of synaesthesia</a>. The lights along the ourside display the colors I see from the music I play on it.

<p>I have a form of synaesthesia that <a href="/superpowers">causes me to see sound and hear light</a>.</p>

<p>To show others what this is like for me, <a href="http://brianernst.org">Brian Ernst</a> and I modified a classical guitar to display colors around its edge according to what I see when I’m playing it. A brief rundown of how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pair of <strong>Piezo pickups</strong> records sound from the guitar, which is wired into</li>
  <li>a <strong>guitar tuner</strong>, which routes analog audio data to</li>
  <li>the <strong>USB sound card</strong> that pulse-code modulates that sound, and hands it off to</li>
  <li>the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, which runs a Fast Fourier Transform on the data to extract spectral components, which is driven over a high-speed serial bus to</li>
  <li>the <strong>Arduino Uno</strong>, which modulates the frequency spectrum according to my synaesthesia and sends visual data to</li>
  <li>the <strong>WS2812B lighting strip</strong> that’s wrapped around the body of the guitar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The software running on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino are open source:</p>

</ul>

Below is a video recording of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ayx5btnCPw">the talk</a> and performance I gave with this instrument at <a href="http://tedxsalem.us/">TEDxSalem</a> in 2014.</p>
