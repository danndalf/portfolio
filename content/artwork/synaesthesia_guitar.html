title: Synaesthesia Guitar
byline: This is a guitar that I've modified to simulate <a href="/writing/mutant_superpowers">my form of synaesthesia</a>. The lights along the ourside display the colors I see from the music I play on it.

			I have a form of synaesthesia that <a href="/writing/mutant_superpowers">causes me to see sound and hear light</a>. To show others what this is like for me, <a href="http://brianernst.org">Brian Ernst</a> and I modified a classical guitar to display colors around its edge according to what I see when I’m playing it. A brief rundown of how it works:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>A pair of <strong>Piezo pickups</strong> records sound from the guitar, which is wired into</li>
		  <li>a <strong>guitar tuner</strong>, which routes analog audio data to</li>
		  <li>the <strong>USB sound card</strong> that pulse-code modulates that sound, and hands it off to</li>
		  <li>the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, which runs a Fast Fourier Transform on the data to extract spectral components, which is driven over a high-speed serial bus to</li>
		  <li>the <strong>Arduino Uno</strong>, which modulates the frequency spectrum according to my synaesthesia and sends visual data to</li>
		  <li>the <strong>WS2812B lighting strip</strong> that’s wrapped around the body of the guitar.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The software running on the <a href="https://github.com/linenoise/guitar_pi">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linenoise/arduino/blob/master/guitarduino/guitarduino.ino">Arduino</a> are open source. <a href="/images/artwork/synaesthesia_guitar/guitar_wiring.png">The wiring diagram for this instrument</a> is available as well. There is also a video recording of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ayx5btnCPw">the talk and performance I gave with this instrument</a> at <a href="http://tedxsalem.us/">TEDxSalem</a> in 2014.
