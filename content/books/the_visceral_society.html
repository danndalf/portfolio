         <span class="dropcap">S</span> ometimes jokingly called Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 2007 by my peers, The Visceral Society addresses the evolution of human rights and responsibilities through industrialization. Building common ground between free market capitalism, Keynesian theory, and Soviet-style socialism, this integrates a sustainable model of socially responsible economics.</p>

       <p>This is a series of essays on the social theory of human rights with specific application to the period of modernity. Human rights have decayed since industrialization, which in turn degrades the human condition. This is an inherently interdisciplinary text with roots in sociology, political science, economics, linguistics, biology, psychology, economics, and history. Based in a critical theoretical perspective, this book addresses this degradation of rights, and their reconstruction. Much of this book's contents were originally sourced from from articles posted to the author's personal blog during studies in social and critical theory in the Fall of 2007.</p>
