<p>Responsive design: This site is designed to look good in any browser on any device.  It adapts responsively to the device displaying it and to your browser of choice as much as possible.  In some areas such as the music page, graceful feature degradation isn't possible without introducing the insecurities of Flash.  There, you will still be offered the content for download, but will be directed to upgrade your browser for the full experience.</p>

<p>Standards validation: XHTML, CSS, and RSS</p>
