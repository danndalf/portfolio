byline: A free asemic Markov-chained symmetric steganographic engine, this lets you embed one piece of information within another to bypass content filters in places where free speech isn't recognized as a human right.

	         <span class="dropcap">S</span>ometimes, you need to be able to hide information within other information.  Asemica allows you to do this, creating a piece of asemic (meaning "meaningless") text out of three things: the information you're encoding, the body of text you're using to hide it in (the "corpus") and your password.  This is an application that runs through the command line, and can be setup to be used in many of the same ways PGP is used.

	       <p>Asemica is a symmetric steganographic engine whose key is a document and whose ciphertext looks like plaintext. For example, the plaintext "Meet @Joe's, 6pm" could become the ciphertext: "to achieve this and any applicable patent claim is based The Free program INCLUDING a computer or A Major Component in NO EVENT UNLESS and FITNESS FOR an aggregate does terminal interaction through the Program's commands or DATA OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY court order to an appropriate Legal Notices however if the PROGRAM IS addressed as IS addressed as changed so that copyright permission to Apply These requirements of an implementation available for and OR A."</p>

		<p>Any single piece of plaintext should produce any number of cryptographically equivalent ciphertexts, and all of these ciphertexts will decrypt to the initial plaintext when given an identical document-key, called the corpus file. All information about the input file is represented in the states between most of the ciphertext words, rendering the ciphertext asemic.</p>

	     <h3>Technology for Good</h3>

	     <p>As mentioned in <a href="http://www.copio.us/mobile/blog-post/technology-for-good/">my agency blog post on Asemica</a>, this tool can be used to help protect free speech in parts of the world where it's in danger.  This tool runs with a fairly small footprint on Windows, OS X, and Linux.  If you're needing help getting it running, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:dann@stayskal.com">dann@stayskal.com</a>.  You can encrypt your email to me with PGP if needed (my public key is <a href="http://dann.stayskal.com/crypto/93F904B0.asc">0x93F904B0</a>), using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor for anonymity</a> if necessary.</p>
