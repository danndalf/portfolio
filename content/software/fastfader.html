		<p>FastFader is an Arduino library that implements a fast cross-fader and pixel buffer for use with LED lighting strips. It pairs with the <a href="http://fastled.io/">FastLED library</a> to produce smooth, fast animations on WS2810, WS2811, LPD8806, Neopixel and <a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference">other types of lighting strips</a>. The code for <a href="https://github.com/linenoise/fastfader">FastFader is on GitHub</a>.</p>

       	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

		<p>Since this needs to use the <tt>math.h</tt> library, you will need an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMapping168">Arduino ATmega168</a> or better CPU. You will also need to have the <a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/">FastLED</a> library installed.</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>

		<p>To install this library, checkout this codebase and place the FastFader folder next to the FastLED folder in your Arduino Libraries folder. This will usually be in an Arduino folder wherever your operating system keeps documents. Restart the Arduino IDE, and you're ready to go.</p>

		<p>Once this library is installed, you'll need to include it in the header of the <tt>.ino</tt> file for the relevant Arduino sketch. The best place for it will be directly below your <tt>#include</tt> directive for FastLED</p>

<pre><code>#include "FastLED.h"
#include "FastFader.h"

// How many LEDs are in the strip
#define NUM_LEDS 18

// Using the Arduino Uno in dev mode
#define DATA_PIN 2
#define CLOCK_PIN 3
</code></pre>

		<p>Next, where you initialize your LED strip, you'll also need to initialize a fader, then bind them. This should be in your <tt>void setup();</tt> function:</p>

<pre><code>void setup() {
  // Initialize the LED interface
  FastLED.addLeds<LPD8806, DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, RGB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);

  // Bind the pixel fader to the LED interface
  pixel_fader.bind(pixel_buffer, leds, NUM_LEDS, FastLED);
}
</code></pre>
