This allows you to organize and present an archive of data over a lightweight web interface.  It is tested on Linux and Mac OS X,  and might also work under Windows.</p>

			<p>This software generates a simple folder of HTML and CSS files build around your content for you to upload to a server.  There are no databases, javascripts,    PHP files, CGI requirements, or encryption assumptions.  Infoshop will index    and present your data, and includes a few routines to help you publish it.      That's it--the rest is up to you.
