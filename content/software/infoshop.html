		<h2>A lightweight, web-based, static PDF library</h2>

		<p>Infoshop is a set of tools for creating and maintaining a lightweight web interface to a PDF archive.  This allows you to organize and present an archive of data over a lightweight web interface.  It is tested on Linux and Mac OS X,  and might also work under Windows.</p>

		<p>This software generates a simple folder of HTML and CSS files build around your content for you to upload to a server. There are no databases, javascripts, PHP files, CGI requirements, or encryption assumptions. Infoshop will index and present your data, and includes a few routines to help you publish it. That's it--the rest is up to you.
