title: Superpowers
byline: Have you heard of Synaesthesia? It's a genetic trait in some people that causes their senses to cross. This application demonstrates what it's like on a day-to-day basis for me to see sound and hear light.

		<h2>An Android app to demonstrate what Synaesthesia feels like.</h2>

		<img class="alignright framed" src="/images/software/superpowers_screenshot.png" width="617" height="200" alt="Superpowers Screenshot" />

		<p>This is an alpha release of the first working build of this application that <a href="http://adaburrows.com/">Jill Burrows</a> and I demonstrated at CyborgCamp Portland 2012 on November 3rd, 2012.</p>

		<p>This app might not work on your device, and might crash on exit. We're working to fix these issues.</p>
		
		<p>Before running this app in its current state, you will likely want to have headphones plugged in to prevent a feedback loop--otherwise, you might hear a shrill noise while it's running. Also, you'll need to make sure your media volume is turned to a reasonable level, otherwise you won't see any synaesthetic overlay on the main video.</p>
