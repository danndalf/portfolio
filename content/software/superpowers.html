byline: Have you heard of Synaesthesia? It's a genetic trait in some people that causes their senses to cross. This application demonstrates what it's like on a day-to-day basis for me to see sound and hear light.

				This is an alpha release of the first working build of this application that <a href="http://adaburrows.com/">Jill Burrows</a> and I demonstrated at CyborgCamp Portland 2012 on November 3rd, 2012.

			<p>
				This app might not work on your device, and might crash on exit. We're working to fix these issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before running this app in its current state, you will likely want to have headphones plugged in to prevent a feedback loop--otherwise, you might hear a shrill noise while it's running. Also, you'll need to make sure your media volume is turned to a reasonable level, otherwise you won't see any synaesthetic overlay on the main video.
