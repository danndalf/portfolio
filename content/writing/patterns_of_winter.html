		<p>We heard you standing still aboard<br />
		cathedrals of temporal tribes,<br />
		but that for which there is no word,<br />
		not strength, nor sense, nor skill describes.</p>

		<p>So speak to me of gravity,<br />
		in fermionic quantum spins.<br />
		That geodesic alchemy<br />
		arrests like quiet, playful grins.</p>

		<p>I'll trace elliptic curves beyond<br />
		your phosphorescent, glowing crown.<br />
		To which you tenderly respond,<br />
		"It's people all the way around."</p>

		<p>In our beginning was the word,<br />
		along this path of lantern song,<br />
		detritus bright and seldom heard,<br />
		for not all darknesses are long.</p>

		<p>A prayer to my pilgrim clan<br />
		that may be clear by now to some:<br />
		You lose that which you cling to, and<br />
		you keep what you become.</p>
